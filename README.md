# day-planner

## description
This is a daily planner. The planner only displays the working hours 9-5. Eath time block on the planner will change colers based on if the time is current in the future or in the past. The text in the time block will also be save throught the day if the save button is pressed.

## installation
We were given starter code of an HTML file and a CSS file. I started by making the grids and the outline for the text area and the save button and the hour block. I reapeted this step eihght times to make the time block. Next I made the JavaScript file and then first made a function comparing all of the blocks to the current time to compare if it was the current, past or present hour with a series of if else statements. Then I started the starter function that presents the time at the top of the page aswell as a function to display the text if the save button is pressed.
